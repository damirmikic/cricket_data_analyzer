# üèè Cricket Data Analyzer

A comprehensive Streamlit application for analyzing cricket match data with advanced statistical summaries designed for Markov chain simulation modeling.

## Features

### üìä Multi-Match Analysis
- **Match Summaries**: Standardized match information and outcomes
- **Player Statistics**: Aggregated batting and bowling stats across matches
- **Ball-by-Ball Data**: Detailed delivery-level analysis
- **Betting Market Summaries**: Comprehensive match outcome data

### üéØ Markov Chain Statistics (NEW!)
Advanced statistical analysis specifically designed for cricket simulation:
- **Runs per Ball Analysis**: Probability distributions for 0-6 runs
- **Phase-wise Breakdowns**: Separate stats for powerplay, middle overs, and death overs
- **Run Rate Patterns**: Expected scoring rates by match phase
- **Wicket & Boundary Analysis**: Fall patterns and frequencies
- **Transition Probabilities**: Ready-to-use data for Markov chain models

### üìà CSV Analysis Tools
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary of numerical data
- **Frequency Analysis**: Categorical data breakdowns
- **Toss Analysis**: Impact of toss decisions on match outcomes

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-data-analyzer.git
cd cricket-data-analyzer
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas plotly
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

### Data Input
- Upload JSON cricket match files (supports multiple files)
- Use CSV files generated by the app for further analysis

### Navigation
1. **JSON Data Analyzer**: Primary analysis tool for cricket match data
2. **CSV Market Analyzer**: Secondary tool for analyzing exported summaries

### Markov Chain Statistics
The app generates comprehensive statistics useful for cricket simulation:

- **State Definition**: Use phases (powerplay/middle/death) and current score as states
- **Transition Probabilities**: Use runs distribution percentages for each phase
- **Wicket Modeling**: Use wicket percentages to model dismissals
- **Boundary Modeling**: Use four/six percentages for aggressive batting scenarios
- **Run Rate Targets**: Use phase-wise run rates for realistic scoring patterns

## Data Format

The app expects JSON files in the standard cricket data format with the following structure:
```json
{
  "info": {
    "teams": ["Team A", "Team B"],
    "dates": ["YYYY-MM-DD"],
    "venue": "Stadium Name"
  },
  "innings": [
    {
      "team": "Team A",
      "overs": [
        {
          "over": 0,
          "deliveries": [
            {
              "batter": "Player Name",
              "bowler": "Bowler Name",
              "runs": {
                "batter": 4,
                "extras": 0,
                "total": 4
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Export Options

- **Match Summaries CSV**: Standardized match data
- **Player Statistics CSV**: Batting and bowling aggregations
- **Ball-by-Ball CSV**: Detailed delivery data
- **Markov Chain Statistics CSV**: Simulation-ready probabilities
- **Market Summaries CSV**: Betting market outcomes

## Key Statistics Generated

### Overall Metrics
- Average runs per ball and run rates
- Ball outcome probabilities (0-6 runs)
- Dot ball, boundary, and wicket percentages

### Phase-wise Analysis
- **Powerplay** (Overs 1-6): Aggressive start phase
- **Middle Overs** (7-15): Consolidation phase  
- **Death Overs** (16-20): Final acceleration phase

### Simulation Parameters
- Transition probabilities for each run outcome
- Wicket fall patterns and intervals
- Boundary frequency analysis
- Run rate patterns by match phase
